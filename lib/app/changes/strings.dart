    "CPR training supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. By equipping individuals with the skills to perform CPR, it enhances emergency response capabilities, improves survival rates from cardiac arrests, and reduces the impact of sudden medical emergencies. This contributes to better health outcomes, increased resilience in communities, and ultimately supports the broader goal of reducing preventable deaths and improving overall health and well-being.";
String cprContent =
    "CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a life-saving technique used in emergencies when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. It involves a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths to restore blood flow and oxygen to the brain and other vital organs. CPR can be performed by anyone trained in the procedure and can significantly increase the chances of survival until professional medical help arrives. Basic steps include ensuring the scene is safe, calling emergency services, starting chest compressions, and providing rescue breaths if trained to do so. Scroll down and click the video below to learn CPR intervention for adults and babies respectively.";
String chockingContent =
    "Air enters the lungs through the trachea (windpipe). Choking is caused when a foreign object, like a hard lump of food, bead, or a small toy goes into the trachea instead of the oesophagus (food pipe). Choking may be a life-threatening medical emergency, because it cuts off oxygen supply to the brain which can only survive a few minutes without oxygen. First aid can save the life of a choking person if applied correctly and promptly. Scroll down and click the video below to watch the choking interventions for adults and children.";
